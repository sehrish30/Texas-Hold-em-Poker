A game with python unittest
A card game played with 52 cards deck. Deck has 13 ranks. Ranks e.g “Jack, Ace, Queen etc”. For each rank we have 4 suits e,g “Diamonds, Spades etc”.

Project has a deck class that shuffles cards. Deck provides each player with 2 cards.

Players make a bet based on two cards and other players agree to match that bet, raise it or fold(quit).

Deck class will provide community cards(flop) that will be accessible by the entire community of  players.

Now each player will bet again based on their value of cards and more players will drop out.

Now, one more card is placed on a table accessible by the community of players called “Turn”.

Next, there will be another round of betting and one another card is placed on the table called “River”.

Now each player has 2 private cards and 5 community cards shared by all.

Now, all the wagers are done players show their cards and the winner is the one who has the best cards(best hand).

Combination of community cards and a player's private cards is called “hand”.

Every hand has its rank from best to worst. The best hand is the one that is the most rare(the one less likely to happen).
